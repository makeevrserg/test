# Code of Conduct

Please accept, that every pull request can't be reviewed and approved immediately.

Our Standarts:

* **Be open and friendly**
* **Be patient**
* **Be agreeable**: Sometimes, we have another opinion.
* **Be respectful**: Don't insult, troll, harass or use personal/political attacks.
* **Use English language**: Our preferred language is English. This makes it easier for all
  contributors to understand each other.
* **Provide relevant details**: Describe your environment and the problem, how it can be reproduced
  and how it was solved.
* **Think about other users**: Is the feature helpful for many users? Or is the change
  user-specific? Might there be a better solution?
* **Stick to the Style guide**
